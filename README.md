# Data Wow Post App Test

Small text + images post app

## Content

Here is the Post App project coded in Flutter, there is an APK already built at the main branch. 
I took the liberty to add a title for each post, as well as a self-developing carousel to display the images.
The database used is Firebase.

The files of the Flutter project are all located in the "lib" folder.
